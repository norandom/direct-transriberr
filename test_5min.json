So there is a discrepancies between what is said in the book about the implementation and what is understood at least by many of us if not all of us to be the way to implement that and the way that it has been implemented in ML Finland by Hudson and Tames. I have also been in touch with the engineers there and they simply said that some of the it that it was vague in the book the way that it was supposed to be implemented and some of the things that if you followed the book didn't really work and we would have aware of that because I will share the part of the code with you there is a part that they call reading from the other screen",
